      <description>TL;DR use bpf_probe_read_kernel() to read structs in the kernel. in a sense, debuging it to printing. Writing a bcc script to test your ebpf_exporter script is a good debugging method. The problem We have servers in different zones, which have different subnets. We want to use ebpf_exporter1 to monitor network throughput from subnet1 to subnet2. So I have to write some bcc scripts.
Some tcp throughput is sent from subnet1 to subnet2 using ipv6. But the servers don&amp;rsquo;t have real ipv6 addresses, they have ipv4 addresses embedded in ipv62.</description>
