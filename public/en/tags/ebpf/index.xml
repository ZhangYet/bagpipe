      <description>TL;DR use bpf_probe_read_kernel() to read structs in kernel. in some sense, debuging it to insert print. Writing a bcc script to testify your ebpf_exporter script is a good debug method. Problem We have servers on different zones, which have different subnets. We want to use ebpf_exporter1 to monitor network throughput from subnet1 to subnet2. So I need to write some bcc scripts.
Some tcp throughput is sending from subnet1 to subnet2 by ipv6. But the servers haven&amp;rsquo;t got ture ipv6 address, they have ipv4 addresses embedded into ipv62.</description>
