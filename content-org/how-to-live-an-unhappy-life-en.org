#+TITLE: Recalling My Middle School Alma Mater
#+SUBTITLE: How to live an unhappy life

This post is translated by deepseek.

My middle school alma mater celebrated its 25th anniversary on April 19th.
I’m not entirely sure why the date was April 19th instead of September 1st,
the start of the autumn semester. But never mind—let future historians figure that out.
* Six Years of Middle School – Boarding Life
My alma mater was also called the Experimental Middle School,so I'll refer to it as EMS hereafter.
Our small county town had three "key middle schools" (elite public schools), but EMS was the least prestigious at the time.
Why did I end up there? Because during those years of education reforms, the other two key schools stopped admitting junior
high students, leaving me no choice.

EMS was originally located in the old town, near the local teachers' college and adjacent to the elementary school
I attended in grades 5-6. It’s unclear exactly when the school relocated to its new campus.
The new campus sat along a main road. The teaching building was divided into two wings,
each with three rows of classrooms. Between them stood two administrative blocks,
forming a central plaza surrounded by eight buildings in total. A stage occupied the plaza,
with a flagpole beside it where weekly flag-raising ceremonies were held.
New Year’s Eve galas and group movie screenings also took place here.

Throughout my six years, EMS never had enough dormitory space to accommodate all boarding students.
Priority was given to female students and graduating classes (Grade 9 and Grade 12).
During junior high, we lived on the fourth floor of the teaching building, while in grades 10-11,
we moved to vacant rooms in the central administrative block.

The dormitories were essentially repurposed classrooms. A single room designed for 60 students
would be crammed with bunk beds, housing about 40 of us. They were sweltering in summer and freezing in winter.
The ceiling fans couldn’t reach all the beds—some upper bunks barely got a breeze, let alone the lower ones.

We had to fold our blankets every morning after waking up, and oddly, if we hung mosquito nets, we had to roll them up each day.
Eventually, I stopped using a net altogether—partly to avoid the hassle, partly because of the heat. Miraculously,
I never got sick from mosquito bites. Boarders also took turns cleaning: sweeping and mopping the floors.
I hated this chore. Our beds were covered with cheap straw mats that constantly shed debris, making it impossible to sweep thoroughly.

The school provided separate bathhouses for boys and girls, but I hardly ever used them. The men's bathhouse had no privacy stalls,
and I can't even recall if there was hot water. To save time, most of us "bathed" in the school toilets.
The plumbing in that rundown building was terrible—water pressure dropped to zero on the third and fourth floors after evening
classes. We'd fill buckets at noon, let the water sit until night, and use one bucket to wash ourselves
(I'm not sure if we also washed clothes with that same water). This only worked if no one stole our water,
which relied on classmates' honesty. The toilet stall doors were often broken—when I visited during Lunar New Year years later,
they were even worse. Some might have been broken since my student days. The doors were the least of our worries:
due to low water pressure, toilets rarely flushed properly, drains clogged for weeks, and… well, I'll spare you the details.

Laundry was another headache. We hand-washed everything (no idea if they have laundry rooms now),
wrung clothes poorly, and fought for limited drying space. Clothes often stayed damp, forcing us to wear them half-wet.
Guangdong's infamous HuinanTian (humid spring "sweating walls" season) became my nightmare—clothes never dried,
floors stayed slick (especially when it was my turn to mop). Ironically, my cleaning shifts always seemed to align
with HuinanTian (though given how long the season lasts, maybe it wasn't a coincidence).
Unrelated, but I must emphasize: I hated cleaning.

In Grades 9 and 12, we moved to "formal" 12-person dorms. Conditions barely improved—water issues,
dampness, and useless fans persisted. The dorm building housed both genders, with terrible lighting:
boys occupied floors 1-2, separated by two locked doors. It's a miracle no fires broke out over the years.
The walk back to dorms after evening classes had its moments, but nothing truly memorable ever happened.

Midday naps were mandatory. I rarely slept, often waking up disoriented and melancholy. Beside the teaching building
stood a stairwell tower. One afternoon, I peered through the gap between the tower and the building and caught
a glimpse of dazzling blue sky. That fleeting moment, oddly, is what I recall most vividly from those years.
* Six Years of Middle School – Academics
Starting from my first year of middle school, morning self-study began at 7:00 AM, but students were required to arrive
by 6:45 (or 6:50—I'm hazy) to start early. At 7:30, we'd head downstairs for group exercises.
I forget when the first class actually started, and whether each period lasted 40 or 45 minutes.
Evening study sessions kicked off at 7:00 PM (again, with an earlier arrival time).
Day students went home at 9:40 PM, while boarders stayed until 10:10 or 10:20 (I can't recall exactly).

From junior high onward, we attended classes on Saturdays. By Grades 11 and 12, the schedule intensified to
six full days of classes per week, plus half a day of self-study on Sundays.
Whether junior high reached this level of rigor, I can't remember.
